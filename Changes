          Add support for inline::c lookup tables for afunc and dafunc. This
          saves 60-70% of the time spent in these functions for a sub-ms init
          time. These have a resolution of up to 0.001. Write your own if that
          is a problem. Also, the min and max neuron values are now applied
          before the activation function, to provide bounds for the lookup
          table.

          Additional (working) example using the mutate() option. Works quite 
          well, but slowly.

          Now we use Moose!

          SimWorld skeleton is also complete. See the script in examples for 
          a simple example without any actual evolution.

          Tests for Simworld.

          Initial release. ::Robot is a basic replacement for the AI::ANN 
          constructor. Some tests, which, amazingly, all pass.
